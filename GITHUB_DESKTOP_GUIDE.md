## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: METHOD 1 (Simpler!)

Since your project is already set up with git, Method 1 is faster!

---

## 📋 VISUAL GUIDE FOR METHOD 1:

```
GitHub Desktop
├── File Menu
│   └── Add Local Repository...
│       └── Choose... → /Users/dvv/Documents/Cursor/Invite
│           └── Add Repository
│
└── Publish Repository Button (top)
    └── Publish Repository dialog
        ├── ✅ Name: Invite (or your repo name)
        ├── ✅ Description: Telugu invitation
        ├── ☐ Keep code private (UNCHECK)
        └── Click "Publish Repository"
```

---

## ⚠️ IF YOU SEE "REPOSITORY NOT FOUND" ERROR:

This means GitHub Desktop doesn't see the git repository. Here's how to fix:

### Quick Fix in Terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/dvv/Documents/Cursor/Invite

# Check if git exists
git status

# If it says "not a git repository", initialize it:
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Telugu house warming invitation"
```

Then go back to GitHub Desktop and try Method 1 again!
